// ********************************************************************************************************************
// Menu Stubbing Project
// C. A. Ybarra
// October 1 2020
//
// Purpose: Using a self-selected programming language and menu display method, create a stubbed code file and executable.
//
// Requirements:
//    1. The menu shall contain at least 10 menu items.
//    2. The menu shall contain an exit item selection.
//    3. The menu shall contain an error response for invalid entry.
//    4. The menu shall display a message indicating that an item was incomplete when selected.
//    5. The menu shall be continuously displayed until the exit item is selected.
//
//	Version 3:  Date: 10 Oct 2020
//				Modified by: C. A. Ybarra
//				Modifications:
//                              		(1) Included do-while loop
//      Version 4:  Date: 17 Nov 2020
//				Modified by: C. A. Ybarra
//				Modifications:
//						(1) Completely removed do-while loop, to correct errors.
//						(2) Changed to while loop only.
//						(3) Included function for menu to display menu, and accept user choice of color.
//						(4) Included function for display to show results based on user input from menu function.
//						(5) Included exit functions for exit options offered by program.
